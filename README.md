-- N-puzzle solver columbiaX AI course project

Solver implements Bread-First Search, Depth-First Search , A* and Iterative Deeping A* search algorithms to find solution for a given board configuration.

Running the solver
==================
 python driver.py <method> <board>

 -methods: bfs, dfs, ast and ida
 -board: eg. 3,1,2,0,4,5,6,7,8

 eg. python driver.py bfs 3,1,2,0,4,5,6,7,8
